PURPOSE: In this time of heightened global crisis, everybody wants to know 
what exactly is happening. This data analysis serves purposes of:
- Providing up-to-date statistics regarding COVID-19 throughout the world
- Generating visualizations of the statistics of [at most 5 at a given 
time] countries
- Providing the "Response Factor," which is essentially the number of
days it took for a country to reach its maximum number of active cases.
As of now, the Response Factor will not be accurate as many countries are
yet to reach their maximum.
- Finding the relationship between the Global Health Security Index and 
the Response Factor in a scatter plot
- Finding the relationship between the Confirmed-Active cases ratio and
the Response Factor in a scatter plot
