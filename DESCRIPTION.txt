PURPOSE: In this time of heightened global crisis, everybody wants to know 
what exactly is happening. This data analysis serves purposes of:
- Providing up-to-date statistics regarding COVID-19 throughout the world
- Generating visualizations of the statistics of [at most 5 at a given 
time] countries
- Finding the relationship between the time it took for a country's 
government to respond and the time it took for the rate of death and 
cases reach their apex (to analyze how different governments reacted and
determine how they should in the future)
   - Dividing the former by the latter will provide the "Response Factor"
   - The higher the Response Factor, the better the country is performing
   - The Response Factor will always be between 0 and 1
- Finding the relationship between the Global Health Security Index and 
the Response Factor in a scatter plot
- Finding the relationship between the GDP drop (in %) of a country and
its Response Factor
